        <h1>Salary Expectations</h1>
        <p>Web developer salaries can vary slightly depending on the specific job and company. For example, you could be a front end developer, back end developer, full-stack (front and back end), junior, mid, or senior developer. All of these roles will pay slightly differently, though the common trait between them is the junior, mid and senior levels. For the sake of conciseness and clarity, we'll discuss average base full-stack developer salaries at each of the three levels. The following data is all from Glassdoor.</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Junior</th>
                <th>Mid</th>
                <th>Senior</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>$63,502</td>
                <td>$71,038</td>
                <td>$104,656</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Generally speaking, most employers will look for either a bachelor's degree, or experience in lieu of a degree, for junior roles. As you move up to the mid and senior levels, the main requirement becomes experience, though pursuing higher education, i.e. a master's degree, is always a good idea if you can afford it. It should also be noted, as stated previously on the <a href = 'TrainingAndEducation.html'>Training and Education</a> page, that many companies are also accepting coding bootcamps in lieu of degrees for entry level positions.</p>
