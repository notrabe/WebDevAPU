        <p>A web developers job is to write the code for a website and its necessary applications, according to the specifications of the client or the developer's employer. Web developers will typically work with a design team to determine the layout of the website, and use their knowledge of the code to build the site. At some companies, mainly smaller companies, developers may also be responsible for designing the website themselves, though this varies from role to role. </p>
        <p>Some developers will handle all aspects of a website's code, while others may focus on a specific area. For example, there are what is known as front-end developers, back-end developers, and full-stack developers. Front-end developers are responsible for how a website <span class = 'italic'>looks</span>, back-end developers are responsible for how a website <span class = 'italic'>functions</span>, and full-stack developers are responsible for both.</p> 
        <p>Typically, full-stack developers will earn more than front-end or back-end developers because they are essentially responsible two jobs. For more discussion on salary, be sure to check out the <a href = 'SalaryExpectations.html'>Salary Expectations</a> page.</p>
