        <h1>Knowledge and Skills</h1>
        <p>Entry level web developers should at least have a thorough understanding of what I would consider to be the three core programming languages on the internet: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Once you have mastered these three, the requirements for specific jobs will vary slightly from company to company. For example: some companies will use different frameworks (i.e. React (it should be noted that React <span class = 'italic'>technically</span> isn't a framework, but many companies will list it in job descriptions as one), Angular, Vue), and some companies will look for graphic design experience, if your particular job requires that you be involved with the design of the website. Above all though, developers must be wiling to learn throughout the course of their career, as things are constantly evolving.</p>
        <p>You should also: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be comfortable working as part of a team.</li>
                <li>Have decent interpersonal skills.</li>
                <li>Be analytical.</li>
                <li>Be willing to perform a lot of testing and debugging.</li>
            </ul>
