        <p>Education requirements for web developers can vary somewhat from company to company. FAANG companies (i.e., Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) will often require a bachelor's degree and several years of experience for entry level positions. That's not to say it's impossible to get in without those credentials, but it will be significantly harder. Most employers prefer a bachelor's degree, and require at least an associate's degree, although this is changing somewhat with the increasing prevalence of coding bootcamps like Lambda School, App Academy, Thinkful, and those offered by Trilogy Education at a plethora of universities around the country.</p>
        <h3>Should you go to a coding bootcamp instead of a university?</h3>
        <p>This is a very common question among those looking to get into the world of web development, and honestly there's no easy answer. It's a bit more in depth than a simple 'yes' or 'no'. As someone who is doing <span class = 'bold'>both</span>, I feel I am at least somewhat qualified to give my two cents.</p>
        <p>Coding bootcamps are perhaps most famous for what's known as an ISA, or income share agreement. ISAs allow students to attend a bootcamp, without having to pay until a certain criteria is met. In most cases, that criteria is getting a job that pays over a certain amount. In my case, I don't have to pay for Lambda School until I get a job that pays over $50,000 anually. Once I do get a job that pays $50,000 anually, I have to pay Lambda 17% of my income for 24 months, or up to $30,000, whichever comes first.</p>
        <p>First, it must be established that not all bootcamps offer income share agreements. Trilogy Education, a bootcamp provider at many universities around the country, is one of these. The way these bootcamps work is you pay them a flat amount up front, or finance the cost of tuition for specified period of time. The Trilogy bootcamp nearest me, at UNC-Charlotte, is $11,000. The bootcamp lasts for 3 months, and there is no assurance of a job.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Lambda School, App Academy, and Thinkful all offer ISAs. While none of these bootcamps offer a flat-out job guarantee, it's extremely important to note that you don't have to pay them anything until you get a job. In other words, they have a huge incentive make sure you succeed, because if you don't, they don't. At times, these schools will even offer students the option of taking a living stipend while attending the program, Thinkful and Lambda School have both done this at times.</p>
        <p>There are three main drawbacks, that I have noticed, to attending a coding bootcamp:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The workload.</li>
                <li>The length of time you have to go without a job.</li>
                <li>People with a degree will always have an edge over you.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>When you attend a coding bootcamp, you are essentially cramming the education of a bachelor's degree, minus the gen. ed. courses, into the length of the bootcamp. This will become insanely stressful at times. If you're attending a bootcamp full-time you won't be able to work at the same time, not even part-time. If you attempt this, you will most likely seriously hurt yourself. 9 months, as is the case with Lambda School, is an extremely long time to go without any income. Luckily, my circumstances allowed me to pursue it, but you personally need to make sure you'll be able to get through the length of your bootcamp without being completely drained of finances. And for the last point, this is an unfortunate consequence of not going to a university. For some people, a bootcamp may be their only option, and that is  totally okay. The unfortunate truth is, however, that people with a degree will always have a slight leg up on you in interviews. If you want to just go to university, and not go to a bootcamp, then by all means do that as well. It's probably the most common path for developers. Bootcamps simply offer a faster way, less expensive way into the field. This however, comes with a price. At the end of the day, you have to make your own decision. Above all though, whatever decision you make, you have to own it, and pursue it as hard as you can.</p>
        <p>My personal suggestion is to, if you can, do a bootcamp full time, and university simultaneously part time. If not, do the bootcamp first, get a decent-paying job, and attend university as you see fit. </p>
