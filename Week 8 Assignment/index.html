        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>My name is Evan. I'm currently a student at two schools, studying Web Development at both. Lambda School, a coding bootcamp is what I spend most of my time working on. I've so far been a part of teams that have designed  web-based applications for use with Reddit, as well as an application, similar to WikiHow, for "How-To's". At Lambda, I have learned/will learn the following over the course of 40+ hours per week for 9 months:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML.</li>
                <li>CSS.</li>
                <li>JavaScript.</li>
                <li>React.</li>
                <li>Node.</li>
                <li>Java.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In additon to Lambda, I'm concurrently attending American Public University, where I am studying Information Technology, with a programming concentration. However, in September of 2020, I'll be changing my degree to a Bachelor's in Computer Technology with a Web Development concentration. I'm scheduled to graduate from Lambda in April of 2021, and from APU in September of 2021.
